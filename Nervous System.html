1.Has mass only 2 kg , about 3 % of toatal body weight and the most complex system of the body.<br>
2.There are two types of nervous systems <br>
a. central nervous system (CNS)<br> b. peripheral nervous system (PNS)<br>
<b>Neurology:</b> Deals with the noraml functioning and disorders of the nervous system.<br>
<b> Central Nervous System (CNS)</b><br>
1.Consist of the brain and the spinal cord.<br>
2.The brain has around 85 billion neurons and the spinal cord has around 100 million neurons.<br>
3.The spinal cord is connected to the brain via the foramen magnum of the occipitl lobe.<br>
4. CNS processes many kinds of sensory information, it is souece of thoughts, emotions and memories<br>
<br>
<b>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</b><br>
1.Nervous tissue outside the body is include in the PNS
<b> Nerve:</b>It is the bundle of hundreds of thousands of axons plus associated conncetive tissue and blood vessels that lies outside the brain.<br>
Twelve pair of nerves arises from the cranial and 31 pairs arises from the spinal. Each nerve has specified path in the specific region of the body.<br>
<b>Sensory receptor:</b>refers to a structure that identifies changes in the external or internl environment.e.g touch,
<br>
<br>
The PNS is divided into two divisions that is the motor and sensory <br>
Sensory(afferent):conveys input to the CNS from the sensory receptor in the body. provides information about the somatic senses <br>
Motor(efferent):PNS conveys output from the CNS to effectors.further divided into <br>
a. Somatic nervous system: conveys output from the cns to skeletal muscles only as they are voluntary.<br>
b.Autonomic nervous system(ANS):conveys output from cns to smooth muscles,cardiac muscles and glands.ANS is divided into  the following:<br>
1.Sympathetic nervous sysytem : takes care of support exercise or emergency<br>
2.parasympathetic nervous system :takes care of rest and digest<br>
3.Enteric nervous system:HAs over 100 million neurons around the wall of the GIT . ENS regulates the activity of smooth muscles and glands of GIT
